## BUILDING A MOVIELENS RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

We will explore two types of recommender systems:
1. Collaborative filtering 
2. Content-based filtering. 

The dataset is from [MovieLens](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip)


**What is MovieLens?**

***MovieLens*** is a recommender system that was developed by GroupLens, a computer science research lab at the University of Minnesota. It recommends movies to its users based on their movie ratings. It is also a dataset that is widely used in research and teaching contexts.

**Steps we will be taking**
1. Importing the dependnecies
2. Loading the data
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data pre-processing
5. Collaborative filtering using k-Nearest Neighbors
6. Handling the cold-start problem with content-based filtering
7. Dimensionality reduction with matrix factorization
